    Sex-for-roles: People can believe whatever they want — Zicaloma</h1> 
    <img src="imgf/11.png">
    <p>
      During the week, popular skit maker Isaac Aloma, aka Zicaloma, was accused of demanding for sex from male ‘actors’ he uses in his skits before working with them.

However, in an interview with Sunday Scoop, the comedian stated that the story was a mere fabrication. He said, “I really don’t want to talk about these things. I have been told that if people don’t talk about one, it means one is really not doing well. I don’t blame any blog for writing whatever they want; I blame people who give them audience, because they are just looking for ways to drive traffic to their blogs. I am not clearing any air. People can believe whatever they want to believe”

Aloma, who is a former lecturer, also stated that anybody who claims that he demanded sex from them should speak out. He added, “The best thing is for you to watch my skits. Anybody that looks like an up-and-coming comedian should be asked what they did for me to feature them. Everyone that becomes successful, most pass through a channel. I became successful because I put in hard work. I shot content for years without being recognised until it got to a point when I was recognised by people and my content started going viral.

“I work with anybody who I feel can deliver. I shoot most of my contents with celebrities. That does not negate the fact that I can work with someone who has just 20 followers. I don’t compromise my content for anything. Some people offer me money to feature in my skits but I tell them ‘no’ because I don’t like their acting.”

        How To Sell Peter Obi To Northern Nigerians — Charles Awuzie</h1> <img src="imgf/15.png">
 <p>
“No South Easterner can win a presidential election in Nigeria without the support of Northern Nigeria. This is not a curse, it is a statistical fact. 

Based on the above fact, the major task of supporters of The Peter Obi Presidential Campaign should be to market Peter Obi to Nigerians in the North. To achieve this, I've come up with the following strategic ideas:

1. Translate All Peter Obi's speeches to Hausa and Fulfulde . 

2. Buy Radio airtime in major Radio stations in the North where Peter's Translated Speeches and interviews will be played on a weekly basis.

3. BBC Hausa is vital. Get in touch with them. Grant regular interviews with bbc Hausa and other Hausa and Fulfulde platforms . 

4. Create Physical presence through liason offices in key Northern cities. These offices should be functional and effectively engaging grassroot formations to propagate the message of a new Nigeria. 

5. A powerful Northern Nigerian deputy from Kano, Kaduna or Kastina - the super 3 Ks. 

6. Create a Shadow Cabinet with Shadow Ministers.. 
A Shadow cabinet doesn't have executive power since they are only executive members of government in waiting. Distribute key Shadow Ministries to the 3 Ks. This will create a deep effect in the political conversation in the North. The Shadow Ministers will operate just like normal Ministers, they should be given official cars and their job will include to criticize the original Ministers in the current administration - offering a better alternative to the unsolved problems of the current cabinet. Shadow cabinets are powerful opposition tools. This alone could place Labour Party as the main opposition party displacing PDP which is almost on its way to the grave. 

7. The North is Nigeria's most politically conscious region. They don't vote money, they vote interest. Protect Northern interest in Nigeria while ensuring a balance in the South. 

8. Supporters of Peter Obi must avoid getting into social media wars with Northern Nigerians. Stop the subs....they are your partner in constructing the new Nigeria. I've always maintained that the North is not in enmity with the South. Some evil politicians created a fake division. Peter Obi must expose that division and seek to be a unifier. Supporters of Peter Obi must have at least 10 influential Northerners who are partners in the Rescue Nigeria project. 

9. Avoid religious misunderstandings. Respect each other's religious opinions. 

10. Protect Northern businesses in the South and vice versa.

If Peter Obi is successfully sold to the North, you will see a political miracle in 2023.

Forget those who believe that nothing can happen beyond pdp and apc - when I was building the Gemsbok Group brand, such people also told me that an African cannot build technologies and export it to America etc. They laughed at me until I did it.

Peter Obi is a builder... laugh at him with caution. 

Please pass this message until it gets to Mr. Peter Obi and his campaign team. 

My name is Charles Awuzie and I endorse Mr. Peter Obi for the office of the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria.”
